# Leetcode
And so it begins...


Order of Questions I solved:
- Started Off Tackling "Top Interview Questions" Collection ( https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/ ) -> I liked it because it breaks it down by data structure 
	- Didn't go through it in order (i.e. started off w/trees then moved onto DP because I had never had experience solving those. Whereas w/ array, strings, linked lists I did a bit)
	- the first pass was just focused on getting the answer right just to get familiar w/solving such questions -> efficiency in time complexity / seeing other's better solutions would come later
- Might be worth considering stuff mentioned here ( https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/1041234/Become-LeetCode's-pick!-Win-LeetCoins-and-LeetCode-goodies )


My Algorithm for getting better at solving solving DS&A questions:
1. Get familiar w/the tools you'll be using aka. DS&A (already did some of that having taken a whole udemy course on implementing all data structures and learning when it's good to use them)
2. Improve / hone your problem solving ability ( this is what I'm trying to do now by answering these problems best I can )
3. Master using the tools to solve the problems ( once I get both down well I should be able to do this.  Of course I could just skip 2 and try practicing using the tools to solve the problems - in fact that's what I'm trying to do. It's just even if a find a solution that doesn't use those tools i'm ok with it because main focus is improving problem solving ability
