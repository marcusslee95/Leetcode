# Leetcode
And so it begins...


Order of Questions I solved:
- Started Off Tackling "Top Interview Questions" Collection ( https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/ ) -> I liked it because it breaks it down by data structure 
	- Didn't go through it in order (i.e. started off w/trees then moved onto DP because I had never had experience solving those. Whereas w/ array, strings, linked lists I did a bit)
	- the first pass was just focused on getting the answer right just to get familiar w/solving such questions -> efficiency in time complexity / seeing other's better solutions would come later
- Might be worth considering stuff mentioned here ( https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/1041234/Become-LeetCode's-pick!-Win-LeetCoins-and-LeetCode-goodies )
